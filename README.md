# ObjectOrientedSeleniumForSpecByEgFramework
This framework helps organize your web application's screens and navigation in an object-oriented fashion. Each screen that you have is an object, and each UI field (such as a text box or a button) is a property of the UI screen class. The framework helps you create and organize Specification by Example based Web UI Tests very easily.
