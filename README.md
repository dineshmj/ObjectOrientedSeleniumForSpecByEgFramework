# ObjectOrientedSeleniumForSpecByEgFramework
This framework helps you organize your web application's screens and navigation in an object-oriented fashion for your Web UI tests using Selenium. Each screen that you have is an object, and each UI field (such as a text box or a button) in your screen is a property of the UI screen class. The framework helps you create and organize Specification by Example based Web UI Tests very easily.
